# train-track-tracking
OpenCV based video processing tool for finding discontinuities on train tracks . Ideal for using on drone footage . 
Applications involve large scale automated discontinuity identification for increased safety .


## To do List 
- [*] Reliable Train Track Identification in a Frame 
  - [*] Simple 2 track frame 
  - [ ] Junction , multiple tracks 
- [*] Algorithm to find discontinuities consitently. 
- [ ] Optimisation for faster cloud computing _or_ on board mid-tier processors
